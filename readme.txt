Note this is still a work in progress and that there are bugs. I am not responsable for any damage this program may cause nor am I responsable for any misuse of ths code. Keep this is mind before you use this program.

If you use this code for anything, at least give me some credit in your program. The icons used in this program are being used without permission of the artist. I will be asking for that permission soon though.If you like his icons visit his site at: http://www.geocities.com/siliconvalley/horizon/2229/index.html

-Dump all log information from the server to logs directory with date and time included in filename

-Major changes to all Server log text. Including Time/date stamping

a program to catch IM's from the client for whatever reason! Probably will never be wide spread used, but 
I just added it for the heck of it)

NOTES OF INTEREST:

*Make sure that when you unzip this, that you maintain the directory structure

*Any files you want downloaded by the client, put those files in the files directory within the server directory, and the client downloads to the dl directory in the client directory

*To login you can use:
user: Admin
pass: admin

*Goto Server Options to add new users.

Have fun with this. It is just the beggining of what I want to do with this program. Keep looking for new versions. I will have a web page dedicated to iBBS soon.
