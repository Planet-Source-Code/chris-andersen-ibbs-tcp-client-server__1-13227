Setup user privileges(levels) which can be setup by the admin
Each level can have different online time per connect, number of downloads per day, perhaps more
Error trapping.

These are the last 4 major additions. I am so close to done now.

Minor ones for later are:
Change DAO to ADO
Work on GUI some more
Add favorites list to login form.
Add color support for written mail and messages!
